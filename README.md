<summary>### Essential (must have for completion)</summary>

- [x] I created an HTML page with 4 labeled inputs (Adjective, Animal, Verb, Place).  
- [ ] I added a **Create Story** button.  
- [ ] I linked a JS file correctly and confirmed it runs.  
- [ ] My JS collects values from all input fields.  
- [ ] My JS combines the values into a complete story string.  
- [ ] The story appears in the output area on the page when I click the button.  
- [ ] The story updates correctly each time I click again (no duplicates, no errors).

<details>
<summary>### Good to Have (polish + usability)</summary>

- [ ] My inputs clear automatically after the story is generated.  
- [ ] The cursor/focus jumps back to the first input after each click.  
- [ ] I added placeholder hints in the inputs (e.g., “slimy,” “otter”).  
- [ ] I styled the page with spacing, fonts, or background for readability.  
- [ ] I included accessibility touches (labels, ARIA, hidden headings, good contrast).
