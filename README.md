# ✅ Mad Libs Project Checklist

### Essential (must have for completion)
- [ ] An HTML page is created with 4 labeled inputs (Adjective, Animal, Verb, Place).

- [ ] Values are collected from all input fields in JS.  
- [ ] The values are combined into a complete story string.  
- [ ] The story appears in the output area on the page when the button is clicked.

### Good to Have (polish + usability)
- [ ] Input boxes clear automatically after the story is generated.  
- [ ] Cursor/focus returns to the first input after each click.  
- [ ] Placeholder hints are included in the inputs (e.g., “slimy,” “otter”).  
- [ ] The page is styled with spacing, fonts, or background for readability.  
- [ ] Accessibility features are included (labels, ARIA, hidden headings, good contrast).

### Challenge (extra fun + creativity)
- [ ] More than one story template is included, chosen randomly.  
- [ ] A “Play Again” button resets the game.  
- [ ] A random word generator is built for one or more blanks.  
- [ ] Visual elements are added (images, emoji, background effects).
